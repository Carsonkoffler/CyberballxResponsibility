"Yes, I am happy and satisfied as I got the ball more than SP2, which was nice, and I always passed it back to the treasurer. I was curious to see if the SP2 would ever have passed me the ball out of a trust excercise but he never did. Overall really good made more money than SP2.","Yes I am happy with how much I played, I got the ball 9 times making 45 cents and each time I passed it to the treasurer. Maybe I would have hoped to get the ball 1 more time to make it an even 50 cents rather than a 45 cents bonus.","Yes I am happy with the money I made, I thought I was going to earn less money (by like 10-15 cents) than I initially did but the treasurer was nice and gave me more of the ball. Happy relative to SP2 who only got 15 cents in the end due to me sacrificng 5 cents.","Very very happy as he gave me more of the ball so I was able to make more money. Now, was this fair? Probabaly not but thas life I guess and it benefited me so I liked it most definitely. Maybe I would have passed the ball to SP2 to see how he would have reacted.","Honestly, I was curious to see if SP2 would pass the ball to me which he never did, fair enough as I never did as well. SP2 played the logical game of always passing back to the treasuer to maximise his money earnt during the excercise, exactly the same type of thinking I employed.","I would first thank them for giving me more of the ball throughout the game and it affected me positively not only financially but also emotionally I felt happy that I was gaining more money. I would ask why he gave me more of the ball simply out of sheer curiosity.","I would just say that I respect their decisions and that it did not really impact me per se as I would have done the same in his shoes which I demonstrated by always passing back to the treasurer. Maybe I would have said we should have done a trust excercise.",1
"I think it was a fair game.I wasn't quite sure what to expect going into it. I was pleasantly surprised that player 2 passed the ball to me a couple of time when they were ahead. It was a kind gesture that helped me keep when the treasurer wasn't passing to me.","Yes i am satisfied with how long i got to play. The ball was passed around long enough without getting boring. I was patient while waiting for the ball to get passed to me and was quick to return the pass. If the game had lasted any longer i would have probably lost interested and or started to multitask while finishing the game.","Yes i am satisfied with he money i made from the game. I wasn't expecting much so anything is better than nothing. It was nice that player 2 and i are close in earning so it felt like a fair game. I did not want to deduct anything from their earnings.","I had not expectations going into the game. It seemed like the treasurer favored passing to player 2 though which was a bit annoying a first. But once player two passed to me that helped make it feel more fair. I wonder if the game started with the treasure passing to me first if they would have continued to pass to me more than player 2? ","Player 2 was playing fair and kindly. They got the first ball passed them from the treasurer and more balls passed to them over the entire game. It seems like each time they got ahead by a couple of points they would pass the ball to me to help my catch up and earn points within their range. It made the game feel better.","I would just nicely ask why the choose to pass to player 2 more often and were they following any pattern. Maybe they find it easier throwing in the right direction as opposed to the left where i was positioned, i would ask them that. I would say that their passing to player 2 more often made me feel left out at times.","Good game, thanks so much for including me and passing the ball when you got further ahead. I appreciate you looking out for me and giving me a chance to catch up. It made the game more rewarding for me to stay in and you made it more fun for me.",4
"I am not too satisfied with how the game went. I think I should have been passed the ball an equal number of times as SP2. Either way, I still got the ball more than zero times. And that's a positive in my book. So, I am mostly unsatisfied with how it went.","Not exactly. I'm satisfied that I got to participate at all, but I am unsatisfied with how much I got to play. The treasurer seemed to favor SP2 for some odd reason. Everyone should be included equally and given the same amount of attention in the game. That's just how I see it.","I am satisfied that I got any bonus at all. I do think it would have been better to make a larger amount in the end, though. But at the very least, it isn't zero. That would have been highly unsatisfying to me. I thought maybe I would be included more.","I did not really enjoy the way the treasurer behaved. They mostly favored SP2. I am not sure what their reasoning was. I would have preferred it if they included me more and have me an equal amount of ball throws during the game. I didn't expect to be excluded that much.","The behavior of SP2 was perfectly acceptable. They were not allowed to throw the ball to me so, I cannot fault them for tossing the ball back to the treasurer each time they were thrown the ball. They did what was expected of them and couldn't affect the outcome for me.","I would tell the treasurer that I was not satisfied with their actions. They should have included me as much as the other player so that things we equal. It is best to make sure everyone has an equal chance to participate in the ball tossing game so that they can earn a bonus.","I would tell SP2 that I they did what they had to do, and I found no fault with them. I chose not to punish them because they were bound by the rules of the game. The bonus we earned in the end is acceptable and I wish them no ill will.",2
"I am not satisfied with how the game went for me. The treasurer seemed to favor player two over me. He also threw the ball to player two like three times more than he threw to me. When the game started, it was pretty obvious he was going to throw it to less though.","I am not satisfied with how much I got to play. I wish I could have thrown the ball more. It felt like I was hardly able to throw the ball because I never got the chance to have the ball. If I got the ball more to play I would have been satisfied.","I am not satisfied with how much money I made. I am not satisfied with how much money I made because I was not in control with how much money I could make. The treasurer was the one who decided who got to make money and he chose not to throw it to me, so i could make money.","The behavior of the treasurer definitely felt like he favored player two. I disliked how they behaved. How they behaved met my expectations in that I knew they were going to throw it to player two more than me. I wish they threw the ball more to me, so I could participate in the game more.","I thought the behavior of player two during the game was fine. They followed the rules and could only throw the ball to the treasurer. There is nothing I wish they had done differently since there was a rule that we were not able to throw to each other. So he could only throw it to the treasurer.","I would tell the treasurer that they should have thrown me the ball more. There were times he threw the ball to player two like three times in a row. I would ask him if he knew that he threw to player two about three times more than he threw to me.","I would tell them I was not surprised how the game played out. I would explain to them that the only way it affected me was that I made less money because the treasurer did not throw the ball to me as much they threw the ball to player two.",2
"I am not satisfied with the fact tthe game was so lopsided. I would have liked the treasurer to send the ball to each of us more evently. The other player got it 12 times while I only received it 4 which does not feel fair at all. I didn't want to give up any of my bonus though","I would have liked it to be more evenly matched. i would have liked the treasurer to send the ball to me more. The fact that the other player got it 12 times and I was just watching made the game a lot less fun for me and i was disappointed.","I am satisfied with how much money I made. I am appreciative I received an extra 20 cents. I would have liked it to be more fair but I'm never going to be upset about any bonus at all, regardless of how much another participant receives. i don't want to take anything away from the other participant","I did not like how the treasurer behaved. I felt as if the treasurer priortized player 2. I am not sure why the treasurer prioritized the other player but it disappointed me and i would have liked the treasurer to make things more even between the 2 of us. The fact the other player got it 8 more times than I did felt really lopsided","The other player, player SP2, behaved in a perfectly logical manor. i understand there is no reason the other player would send the ball to me as the other player is only paid when sending it to the treasurer. I am not going to blame the other person at all for making the most logical decision","I would want to know why the treasurer decided for things to be so lopsided. Was there anything I could have done to get the ball passed to me more instead of 1/3 of the time the other player, player SP 2 received the ball. I would just want to understand","i would want the other player to know I'm not upset and don't blame them at all. I understand the other player, player SP2 made the most logical decision in the circumstances. The treasurer is the only who I felt really had the power and I think the treasurer should have done a better job alternating.",3
"No the treasurer did not throw me the ball enough. This made the game unfair. There is no point and having a score if the Treasurer can chose who can win. This made the game utterly pointless. There is no real competition here, just a bunch of clicking and waiting.","No, I watch forced to watch a silly animation throw the ball at the other player multiple times with out getting to throw to get points. Of course there is no way for a game like this to be fair, but I did not get the opportunity to make the game competitive.","No because I did not get to throw the ball at all so my score was super low so reduced my earnings enough that my opponent didn't get as much as he or she was supposed to make things even. There is no point in having a score if the game is fixed","The treasurer was biased towards the other player. It made the game pointless because at the end of the day, there is a score and somebody has to win. If you shift the odds to one person it makes the game super unfair. The treasurer negatively effected my chances at more earnings.","SP2 did what he or she was supposed to do and I don't blame them. The point of the game is to win and if the Treasurer is playing favorites, you might as well score as much as possible. I didn't expect to get the ball from SP2 at all.","I would tell them that they screwed me out of money and made the experience utterly boring. I had no chance of making this competitive because you only threw the ball to SP2. The game was rigged and there was no point in playing it. It ruined the experience for me. ","Fair play, The point of the game is to make as much as money as possible, so I don't take offense at not receiving the ball from him or her. Its up to the treasurer to make the game fair, they obviously didn't. SP2 did what they were supposed to do",3
"I am satisfied because we wound up with equal points. At one point I was wondering if SP2 was going to be biased and only try to get points for itself, but at the game went on, it started to share the ball more and allowed me to get the same number of points so that made me happy.","I am satisfied with how much I got to play because it was a little boring to play the game, it was just clicking once each time you got the ball and didn't have much variation or challenge to it. As long as I got to get as much bonus as everyone else, it was good.","Yeah, I am satisfied with how much money I made because it was the same amount that SP2 earned and no one got an advantage in that way. It might have been interesting to see what I might have made if the treasurer threw it to me more, but that was out of my control.","The treasurer definitely seemed more than a bit biased to SP2 over the entire course of the game, I think it didn't throw me the ball more than a handful of times. I wasn't that bothered by it, it was only an observation, and I went into the game with no expectations, that anything can happen, because it is just a game.","SP2 appeared to be biased at the beginning of it, but then it seemed like it noticed that it was being biased so it gave me a chance to catch up in terms of points. I like that it appeared to have a conscience, which is something I definitely didn't expect.","I would ask the Treasurer why it was biased toward SP2 and why it didn't include me in the game as much. I would be asking mostly out of curiosity why it acted that way, because it was a little strange that it had that form of bias and didn't care about how it might affect other players.","I would want to know if it realized that it was being unfair at some point in the game, and made a conscious decision to alter the strategy. I know it probably realized it could have gotten more points if it wanted but why did it try to be fair after a while?",4
"I think the game is a bit biased. Player 2 doesn't want to throw the ball to me because they probably don't think they will get it back or maybe they get more points by throwing it to the treasurer too. It's not a very fun game to play at all. ","I feel like I didn't get to play that much because player 2 wanted to hog the ball because they figured out that I wasn't throwing the ball back to them, but that was only because I didn't get any points for doing that so I did not have a good reason to. ","No. The amount of money possible was really low, first of all, and then it was even lower because I had no control over when I would have the ball and when I would not have the ball. It would have been nice to be able to make more money. ","I think the treasurer was pretty even. The probably did not care who they threw the ball to. Maybe they made the same amount of money either way. It was basically the same as what I expected. It would have been nice if they threw the ball to me every time. ","I thought they behaved fine. They were trying to get the most money for themselves so who can blame them? I would have done exactly the same thing as they did since they probably got more money from throwing to the treasurer too and they might have needed it for groceries. ","It didn't impact me that much. It is just a game and you can literally only make a few cents tops. It's not like it is making or breaking the bank for me. I would tell them I hope they had a good time playing the game and thanks for playing. ","It didn't impact me much. I hope they needed the money more than I did. I wasn't going to be a jerk and try to take some of their money back and be selfish like that. I would also say I hope they had a good time playing the game. ",3
"I am not at all satisfied as the game was one-sided and unfair. While I threw the ball to player SP2, SP2 never threw the ball to me. The treasurer completely favored player SP2 and threw the ball to them at least three times as many times as throwing the ball to me.","I am not satisfied with how little I got to play. Treasurer and player SP2 mostly played the game of catch between the two of them. Player SP2 never included me in the game and the treasurer rarely included me. I got much less playtime than player SP2 and had less chance to earn.","I am not satisfied with how how much money I made playing the game. The treasurer through 16 or so balls and if the treasurer had thrown the balls equally, player SP2 and I would have each received 8 balls for forty cents. I wasted one throw of 5 cents by throwing to SP2 as they never reciprocated.","I think the behavior of the treasurer was biased and unfair. I did not like how the treasurer behaved and they did not meet my expectations. I expected a fair game from the treasurer were they would have thrown an equal number of balls to player SP2 and myself. Unfortunately, the treasurer favored SP2","I didn't not like player SP2s behavior during the game. Sadly, player SP2 behavior is similar to what I would expect from someone playing a game online with a stranger with player SP2 putting their self-interests first. I wish player SP2 had played a fair game and included me by throwing me the ball so I could have received greater rewards and played more.","When I started playing the game, I was hoping this would be a fair game and you would include me. I felt left out and unwanted when you would repeatedly throw the ball to player SP2 but would only throw me the ball one time. It was like you preferred playing with SP2 and you helped them earn more money.","I was hoping we would play a fun and fair game. Eventhough I didn't receive an incentive for throwing you a ball, I did it to include you and I expected that you would do the same for me. You saw that I was rarely getting the ball and that it was repeatedly being thrown to you. I wish you would have included me more",3
"Yes. Any extra earnings made through the game are purely a bonus payout. Since player 2 has no choice to pass the ball to me, nor is there any incentive to do so, even getting one pass to the treasurer is a bonus akin to finding money on the ground.","Yes. I have no control over how many times the ball gets passed to me. Moreover, there is no logical reason for dissatisfaction. My answer would likely be different if there was some incentive to pass the ball between players. For example, there is a bigger point benefit to SP1 if SP2 passes to SP1 first, then SP1 passes to the treasurer.","Yes. For the same reasons stated above, and sum of money above zero is purely unearned, bonus money. The game has no element of skill or teamwork involved. It is solely up to luck and how the Treasurer passes the ball. Furthermore, there was no initial buy-in from SP1 so it is impossible to not come out ahead.","It doesn't matter. I have literally no way to affect how the treasurer passes the ball around. If I could fully control the game, I would have the treasurer pass the ball evenly between SP1 and SP2. Seeing as this is not the case, I expected nothing and do not wish for things to have been done differently.","Assuming that SP2 was bound by the same rules as SP1, namely that passes can only be made to the Treasurer, there is nothing about SP2's behaviour that is to be like nor disliked. I do not wish they had done differently either because I also got the ball a few times.","The way the Treasurer played did not affect me in any way. If I had received zero passes, thus, zero bonus payout, there would have been an actual demerit in having wasted time just watching SP2 and the Treasurer pass the ball back and forth. However, this was not the case. If I had to say something, I might ask why the Treasurer distributed passes that way.","Again I would not have anything to say because SP2's play during the game does not affect me in any way. The only person who can control my payout and score is the Treasurer. But getting even one pass between SP1 and the Treasurer is a net positive so there is no downside regardless of how few passes I get.",2
"no the treasurer threw the ball the SP2 more often, it was unfair and unequal. The treasuer appears to have had a choice of where to throw the ball becuase they did throw it to me sometimes but a lesser apount than they threw it to SP2, which was unfair ","yes but I could have earnt more if the treasurer threw me the ball more often, but then I was able to adjust the bonus winnings at the end to make it more equitable, I gave a proportion to SP2 because they threw the ball to me even though they would have earnt nil. ","yes because I could adjust it at the end to make it more equitable, the base payment is a good payment amount and the bonus is helpful and appreciated. I dont really get the idea of the game and what the researcher is interested in finding out but it was easy. ","the treasurer's behaviour during the game was unequal and unfair as they prioritised SP2 with more throws, which felt unfair, but they did have choice and agency so they exercised it and ultimately its their choice. it was fair to be able to adjust the bonus winnings at the end ","I appreciated them throwing me the ball so I could throw the ball to the treasurer to earn bonus earnings, especcially because by throwing the ball to me, they didnt earn money themselves. I reflected my appreciation for this in the division of earnings at the end when deciding on the division. ","I would tell the treasurer's their behaviour during the game was unequal and unfair as they prioritised SP2 with more throws, which felt unfair, but I recognise they did have choice and agency so they exercised it and ultimately its their choice, and I appreciate they did throw it to me at all","thanks for throwing it to me a few times so I could earn some money and that is why I gave you a higher proportions of the share of the winnings/bonus. I appreciated them throwing me the ball especially because by throwing the ball to me, they didnt earn money themselves. ",4
"I think the game went well . I am satisfied with it . I was actually glad that it seemed like I received the ball an equal amount of time from the treasure compared to player 2. I also like that Player 2 also tossed me the ball and did not just pass it to the treasure.","I am not completely satisfied with how much I got to play. I feel like my gameplay time could have been longer . Maybe they could have included a timer that let me know how much time I got to pay instead of just cutting me off at a point, cold turkey","I wish I could have made more money ,but I have to say that I am overall satisfied with the money I made. I essentially earned money while getting to play a fun game and I actually did not remember that I was earning money at a certain point, just remembered to pass ball to treasurer.","I think that the treasurer had fair behavior during the game. I like how it behaved and seemed to pass the ball equally to me and the other player. It exceeded my expectations because I thought it was going to be biased on passing the ball to only player 2.","I liked how player 2 acted during the game. It exceeded my expectations. I thought that player 2 was only going to pass ball to the treasurer. I wish they would have passed me the ball more often than they did so I could make a lot more money than them.","I would tell the treasurer that their choices during the game seemed very balanced and fair to everyone involved. It looked like the ball was passed to both players an equal number of times throughout the session. This made the game feel consistent because I always knew I would get another turn soon.","I would tell player 2 that the played the game better than I thought they would at first. They chose to pass the ball to me several times instead of only passing it to the treasurer. This actually made the match end in a better way than I thought it would.",4
"The game went fine.  We both received the ball an even amount of times.  We each threw the ball to the treasurer 8 times.  Nothing surprising happened.  I don't have strong feelings about how the game went.  it went as expected.  I think everything was done fairly.  No big deal.","I am satisfied by how much I got to play.  The playing time was split evenly.  I guess the treasurer got to play more than the standard players, but that was fine.  I wouldn't have minded if the game went a little faster.  It was a little slower than I expected.","Yes, I am satisfied with the bonus.  Both myself and SP2 received the same amount, so that seems completely fair.  I would have played longer for more money, but it wasn't a choice.  I am always pretty happy with any bonus in addition to the basic sum I make for playing a game.","Treasurer played fairly.  They tossed the ball to both players an equal amount of time.  There might have been once where the treasurer threw the ball to SP2 twice in a row, but we each ended up with the same amount of points so it all evened out.  It was all good.","I think SP2 behaved like I would expect.  Each time they received the ball, they threw it back to the treasurer, just like I did. It wouldn't help them to do anything else.  And since the treasurer was basically taking turns throwing us the ball, I didn't expect SP2 to throw it to me to make things even.","I would tell them that I thought they were objective in how they played the game.  They tossed the ball evenly to both of the other players, so it wasn't like they played favorites.  I appreciated that they didn't try to make one person upset and the other person happy.","I would tell them that I thought they played a fair game.  They threw the ball back to the treasurer each time they received it, just like I did.  I would tell them that they played like I expected.  It was very evenly played, so I was satisfied with the results.",1
"Not really as there was an error and I had to play the game and do this part all over again. This is my second time trying to write my impressions of the game. Other than that it was okay overall. Just disappointed that there was an issue at the end. ","Yes I am satisfied but the game should have told me how many rounds before starting. It was very vague as to what was going to happen after starting. I would include a few more instructions next time for other players. I think something that simple should have gone around 20 rounds. ","I think there should be more incentive to earn points. It didn't make sense as to why I would need to pass to the other player since I would nit earn any points that way. Maybe word the instructions in another way so I think I should pass to them. ","It seemed like it was very fair and even for both player 1 and player 2. The treasurer Passed the ball evenly to both players and I didn't mind their behavior during the game. I wish the passing would be a bit faster but that was not expected on my end. ","I have nothing bad to say about their behavior but I didn't understand what the point was for them to try and pass the ball to me. Lots of that aspect of the game felt a bit pointless but maybe I missed something. Just didn't seem necessary for that action ","I would ask them basic questions like why do I need to pass to player 2 anyway if I don't earn points that way. I would ask why they are going so slow as well. The waiting game was too much for such a small game. Something that basic should have been faster. ","I would say hey this game is really slow. I would also ask why would they need to pass to me for no reason. I think the whole thing just wasn't too clear but once again maybe I missed something? I would maybe give them a quick hello or small greeting too. ",1
"I ended up with an even number of points as the other player which was nice. It was nice that the other player threw the ball to me so many times, when the Treasurer seemed to be mainly throwing the ball to the other player instead of throwing it to me.","I got to play a reasonable amount, I do not think it would have been any more satisfying if I had been able to catch the ball more times or throw the ball more times than I did. The only good would have been getting that much more of a bonus.","It was fine, I would always rather earn a higher bonus but the base pay seems pretty reasonable even without the bonus payment amount. To earn a bonus of any amount of money for just clicking my mouse button a few times seems like a fair and reasonable thing to me.","I am guessing there was something in the programming where the Treasurer was designed not to throw the ball to me as often just to see how I would react. I really did not attach much emotion to it or have much of a reaction, I was simply observing what was happening.","I thought it was sweet that they threw me the ball as often as they did even when they would not get any points or money for doing that. Obviously they were not a real person and it was all just part of the same programming to see how I would react.","I am not sure what I would say to a computer program about what it was designed to do and what emotional response it was designed to draw out of me. If it was a person I suppose I would ask them why they seemed to favor the other player for no reason.","I would thank them for throwing me the ball when they did not need to and when they would get no points or bonus money for throwing the ball to me. I would like to thank the computer programmers who programmed that icon to throw the ball to my icon.",4
"Yes I was satisfied with how the game went for the most part. Since it ended with both of us standard players earning the same amount of points and therefore bonus. The only part I did not like was that the other player received the ball more from the treasurer than I did and I was thus reliant on that player to pass the ball to me for me to make up points and thus I did not pass back.","No, I was not satisfied with how much I got to play. The treasurer passed player 2 the ball far more frequently than to me. Because of that, I was reliant on the second player to pass the ball to me to make up the points I was behind. Due to the inequal score and time I got to play I was more focused on passing back to the treasurer every time rather than to the other player.","Yes, I am satisfied with how much money I made in the sense that the scores, and thus money earned was the same. Since both me and the other player earned the same amount I was not slighted in the slightest. Of course more money would always have been better.","I disliked the treasurer's performance or behavior during the game. Since the treasurer passed more frequently to player 2 than to me, their choices did not meet my expectations. I wish they would have passed to each of us standard players equally such that I would have been more free to pass to the other play and reciprocate.","I greatly liked how SP2 behaved in this game. Since SP2 got the ball more frequently than I did, I was reliant on SP2 to pass to me in order to equal the points SP2 scored. SP2 could have easily chosen not to pass to me, in which case I would have not tied with SP2 on the scoreboard.","If I could speak to the Treasurer, I would let the Treasurer know that I was not entirely satisfied with how the Treasurer had passed the ball to SP2 with a noticeably higher frequency than he did to me. I would note that had it not been for the play of SP2, I would have scored lower for no reason other than apparent favoritism. ","I would let SP2 that I was surprised and thankful for him having chosen to pass me the ball several times. I would note that he could have scored higher, and thus gained a larger bonus. I would congratulate SP2 on a game well played in terms of achieving favorable outcomes for both players and how he positively affected my game experience.",4
"I’m satisfied with how the game went for me because I stayed focused, made good decisions under pressure, and contributed consistently. Even when things didn’t go perfectly, I adapted quickly and learned from the experience, which made the overall performance feel successful and rewarding. Thanks for this, was good time.","I’m satisfied with how much I got to play because I was given enough time to stay engaged, contribute meaningfully, and find my rhythm in the game. The playing time felt fair and balanced, allowing me to gain experience and stay involved throughout. Was an interesting game to be honest.","Yes, I am satisfied with how much money I made because it matched my expectations and felt fair for the effort I put in. The amount reflected my time, contribution, and responsibility, making the experience feel rewarding, balanced, and worthwhile overall, and aligned well with my expectations. Good job sir.","I disliked the treasurer’s behavior during the game because it felt biased toward SP2 and did not meet my expectations of fairness. Their decisions appeared uneven and affected the overall experience. I wish they had remained more neutral or nice or fair, and applied rules consistently to all players. Horrible guy.","They were quite nice and tossed the ball to me a few times. I think it would be nice to have a chatbox to communicate with other players so we can decide on what to do. I think it met my expectations. Thanks for being fair despite the asshole treasurer.","You were unfair in how you handled the game, and it was frustrating for me. Your decisions felt biased and affected my experience negatively. When it comes to monetary compensation, I believe you should be more neutral, transparent, and consistent, so everyone feels respected and treated fairly throughout the game. You are an asshole, play more fair. ","I felt that you played the game in a fair and respectful way, which made the experience more enjoyable for me. You were easy to work with and stayed neutral. Sorry I didn't pass the ball more, I was trying to even out the compensation and points system. Thank you",4
"I am not satisfied with how the game went for me.  I felt like it was a one sided game where the Treasurer mostly gave the ball to SP2.  I thought that it was unfair and wished the ball came my way so I could actively engage in the game.","I was not satisfied with how much that I got to play. I felt that I was just sitting there and not participating in the game.  I wish I had more turns to play and participating.  I felt that it was a game of just the Treasurer and SP2 players.","I was not satisfied with how much money that I made.  I was eager to play more to earn more money. It seemed just the 2 players were playing and then were able to earn more.  I would have liked to had more money with more plays coming my way.","I feel that I didn't have much chances with how the Treasurer threw the ball to SP2 the majority of the game. I wish the Treasurer would have thrown me the ball many more times instead of me just sitting there watching them play and me not able to be involved.","I felt that SP2 played fairly.  I think that the Treasurer kept throwing the ball to SP2 so SP2 threw it back.  It was up to the Treasurer to whom the ball would go to so I feel that SP2 was playing well and not doing anything wrong at all.","I would say to the Treasurer that I thought it was a one sided game.  I would also say that I had potential and should of received the ball more. I would say that it was not a fair game and could see that from any perspective of anyone looking in.","I would say to SP2 that it was a good game and they played fairly.  I did not feel that I received enough playing time but I do not think that it was SP2's fault.  I think that SP2 was a good contender and did what they were supposed to do.",3
"I am satisfied with the game. It was an interesting experience. I was curious if the other player would ever throw me the ball, so I threw it to them just to see what would happen. The other player got the ball about three times more than I did. After I threw the ball to player 2, I did not get the ball again. While playing the game, I reflected on the way our society distributes wealth and resources. The game reminded me of some dynamics in our society.","I found it interesting that the game was not fair, in that each player did not receive the ball from the Treasurer an equal number of times. Since I received the ball fewer times, I was less satisfied than if I had gotten the ball an equal number of times or more than player 2.","The monetary reward wasn't high enough to get super invested in the outcome financially. I decided to reduce player 2's winnings at the cost of my own just to see what it would feel like to go against my instinct to keep my winnings and let the other player keep theirs. It felt very unnatural for me to go against my usual urge to find fairness or accept outcomes.","I noticed that they did not throw the ball equally to each player. In a ""real"" game, I would think it was super inappropriate since I expect games to be fair. I would dislike it very much if it seemed one player was getting an unfair advantage, and I did have some of those thoughts during the game.","I wasn't sure what to expect from player 2. I did not have the same expectations of them as the Treasurer, I did not expect them to be impartial to the outcome. Although the instructions did describe the Treasurer as a player, not an official so maybe my expectations of them aren't necessarily appropriate.","If your role was meant to be unbiased, it was definitely not. Games are usually more fun if everyone sees that they are fair and this game did not seem fair. I am not sure what your role was really meant to be, so I will give you the benefit of the doubt.","You could have passed the ball to me a few times so that I would have a chance to play. I chose to make our winnings closer to even, since the game seemed pretty unfair. I supposed you may have done the same if the Treasurer favored me in the game instead of you. ",3
"No, I thought that the treasurer was keeping the ball away from me, they kept passing it to SP 2. I felt that it forced me to pass the ball to the treasurer after SP 2 passed it to me, I felt that I left out of the game because I wasn't receiving the ball much.  ","I wasn't really satisfied because I didn't get to receive the ball much, it was kind of boring, just waiting for the ball, but the treasurer didn't pass the ball towards me as much as I wanted it. So I felt left out, so it was kind of boring just waiting for the ball.","Yes, it's okay, it's only 40 cents I think, it's a good amount of bonus, the other player sp2 received the same so it was fair for both of us. A 40 cent bonus is okay, it's not a lot, but it's something. I think it's fair because we both got the same amount.","I think the treasurer favored the sp2 player because they were passing them the ball more and I wasn't getting the ball passed towards me, and so I ended up disliking it greatly because I felt left out. I think the game was rigged in favor of the other person.  ","They were nice to me, I think that they felt bad that I wasn't getting the ball as much as they were, so they passed me the ball to make it fair for both of us. I think sp2 was a good person because they balanced everything out between us.","I would tell them to make the game fair and pass the ball to both of us, it would make things equal, the game wouldn't feel rigged. I would tell them to treat everyone fair because it's not fair to exclude someone in the game because they want the bonus too.","Thank you for being fair, thank you for passing me the ball because you noticed that the treasurer wasn't passing me the ball. You tried to make the game fair by passing me the ball. Thank you for trying to make the game fair for the both of us, I appeirate you.",4
