    <p style = ""text-align: start; width: 900px""> You are being invited to participate in a research study titled: The Influence of Social Interactions on Decision Making.<br><br>
        This study is being done by Michael McCullough, PhD (Principal Investigator) from UC San Diego. You were selected to participate in this study because you are a representative member of the society the investigators wish to study. 
        The purpose of this research study is to explore how nonverbal social interactions affect the way people talk to themselves. Your participation in this research should last no longer than 30 minutes. If you agree to take part in this study, you will be asked to complete several surveys that ask about your feelings, beliefs, judgments, and personal background.
        Your participation in this study is completely voluntary and you can withdraw at any time. Choosing not to participate or withdrawing will result in no penalty or loss of benefits to which you are entitled. Research sometimes requires that information regarding its purpose not be shared with the research participants because its knowledge could impact the results of the research. 
        Note that none of the aspects of the research being withheld are reasonably expected to affect your willingness to take part. While the tasks you will be asked to perform for this research have been explained, the full intent of the research will not be provided until the completion of the study. At that time, you will have the opportunity to ask questions, including about the purpose of the study and the procedures used, and withdraw your data if you so choose.
        If you have questions about this project or if you have a research-related problem, you may contact the researcher(s), Michael McCullough, Ph.D., Department of Psychology, University of California, San Diego, 9500 Gilman Drive, La Jolla, CA 92093-0109 and by email at memccullough@ucsd.edu. If you have any questions concerning your rights as a research subject, you may contact the UC San Diego Office of IRB Administration at irb@ucsd.edu or 858-246-4777.
        By participating in this research, you are indicating that you are at least 18 years old, have read this consent form, and agree to participate in this research study. Please keep this consent form for your records.</p>

                 In this study, you will play a virtual ball-tossing game with two other participants. The game is designed to simulate social interactions and observe how they affect how you make decisions towards other people.<br><br>
                 The instructions for the game will be provided in the next section. To ensure that everyone understands the rules, there will be a short quiz. If you get any answers wrong, don't worry—you will have the opportunity to review the instructions and retake the quiz until you get all the answers correct.<br><br>

                <p style=""width: 1000px; text-align: start"">In Cyberball there are three players: Standard Player 1 (SP1), Standard Player 2 (SP2), and a Treasurer. <b>You are SP1</b>.
                    <br><br>
                    Your objective in Cyberball is to earn points by tossing a ball. At the end of the game, the points will be converted into a monetary bonus. Each point you earn is worth $0.05. To help you keep track of points, there will be a scoreboard displayed in the top-right corner of the screen during the game.<br>
                    <br>
                    The way the game works is that SP1 and SP2 individually earn points by tossing the ball to the Treasurer. Each time that SP1 or SP2 tossed the ball to the Treasurer, <u>the person who tossed the ball earns one point</u>. In other words, SP1 and SP2 earn points when they get the chance to toss the ball to the Treasurer.  
                    So, for example, if SP1 tosses the ball to the Treasurer, SP1 will earn one point and SP2 will not earn any points. Likewise, if SP2 tosses the ball to the Treasurer, SP2 will earn one point and SP1 will not earn anything. 
                    In this game, you are only allowed to pass the ball to the Treasurer. SP1 and SP2 are <b>not allowed</b> to pass the ball back and forth to each other.
                    <br><br>

    You may choose to reduce SP2’s earnings by giving up some of your own earnings. This is a <u>one-time, one-sided decision</u>. This means only you make this decision; SP2 will not make a corresponding decision.<br><br>

    For every <b>$0.01</b> you give up, SP2’s earnings are reduced by <b>$0.05</b>.<br>
    For example, giving up <b>$0.03</b> reduces SP2’s earnings by <b>$0.15</b>. Choosing $0 means no change to either participant's earnings.<br>
    Earnings for either participant cannot go below <b>$0</b>.<br><br>

    You may move the slider below to see how different choices would affect both participants’ earnings. Moving the slider does not finalize your decision. Your decision is only locked in once you click 'Continue' and move on to the next task.<br><br>

    There is no correct or expected choice. Please use the slider to indicate how much of your own earnings you would like to give up in order to reduce SP2's earnings.

I think I should have been passed the ball an equal number of times as SP2. Either way, I still got the ball more than zero times. And that's a positive in my book. So, I am mostly unsatisfied with how it went."",""dv1_oe_playtime_satisfaction"":""Not exactly. I'm satisfied that I got to participate at all, but I am unsatisfied with how much I got to play. The treasurer seemed to favor SP2 for some odd reason. Everyone should be included equally and given the same amount of attention in the game. That's just how I see it."",""dv1_oe_earnings_satisfaction"":""I am satisfied that I got any bonus at all. I do think it would have been better to make a larger amount in the end, though. But at the very least, it isn't zero. That would have been highly unsatisfying to me. I thought maybe I would be included more."",""dv1_oe_treasurer_behavior"":""I did not really enjoy the way the treasurer behaved. They mostly favored SP2. I am not sure what their reasoning was. I would have preferred it if they included me more and have me an equal amount of ball throws during the game. I didn't expect to be excluded that much."",""dv1_oe_sp2_behavior"":""The behavior of SP2 was perfectly acceptable. They were not allowed to throw the ball to me so, I cannot fault them for tossing the ball back to the treasurer each time they were thrown the ball. They did what was expected of them and couldn't affect the outcome for me."",""dv1_oe_message_to_treasurer"":""I would tell the treasurer that I was not satisfied with their actions. They should have included me as much as the other player so that things we equal. It is best to make sure everyone has an equal chance to participate in the ball tossing game so that they can earn a bonus."",""dv1_oe_message_to_sp2"":""I would tell SP2 that I they did what they had to do, and I found no fault with them. I chose not to punish them because they were bound by the rules of the game. The bonus we earned in the end is acceptable and I wish them no ill will.""}","","","","","",""
