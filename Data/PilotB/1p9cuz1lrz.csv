    <p style = ""text-align: start; width: 900px""> You are being invited to participate in a research study titled: The Influence of Social Interactions on Decision Making.<br><br>
        This study is being done by Michael McCullough, PhD (Principal Investigator) from UC San Diego. You were selected to participate in this study because you are a representative member of the society the investigators wish to study. 
        The purpose of this research study is to explore how nonverbal social interactions affect the way people talk to themselves. Your participation in this research should last no longer than 30 minutes. If you agree to take part in this study, you will be asked to complete several surveys that ask about your feelings, beliefs, judgments, and personal background.
        Your participation in this study is completely voluntary and you can withdraw at any time. Choosing not to participate or withdrawing will result in no penalty or loss of benefits to which you are entitled. Research sometimes requires that information regarding its purpose not be shared with the research participants because its knowledge could impact the results of the research. 
        Note that none of the aspects of the research being withheld are reasonably expected to affect your willingness to take part. While the tasks you will be asked to perform for this research have been explained, the full intent of the research will not be provided until the completion of the study. At that time, you will have the opportunity to ask questions, including about the purpose of the study and the procedures used, and withdraw your data if you so choose.
        If you have questions about this project or if you have a research-related problem, you may contact the researcher(s), Michael McCullough, Ph.D., Department of Psychology, University of California, San Diego, 9500 Gilman Drive, La Jolla, CA 92093-0109 and by email at memccullough@ucsd.edu. If you have any questions concerning your rights as a research subject, you may contact the UC San Diego Office of IRB Administration at irb@ucsd.edu or 858-246-4777.
        By participating in this research, you are indicating that you are at least 18 years old, have read this consent form, and agree to participate in this research study. Please keep this consent form for your records.</p>

                 The instructions for the game will be provided in the next section. To ensure that everyone understands the rules, there will be a short quiz.

                <p style=""width: 1000px; text-align: start"">In Cyberball there are three players: Standard Player 1 (SP1), Standard Player 2 (SP2), and a Treasurer. <b>You are SP1</b>.
                <br><br>
                Your objective in Cyberball is to earn points by tossing a ball. At the end of the game, the points will be converted into a monetary bonus. Each point you earn is worth $0.05. To help you keep track of points, there will be a scoreboard displayed in the top-right corner of the screen during the game.<br>
                The way the game works is that SP1 and SP2 individually earn points by tossing the ball to the Treasurer. Each time that SP1 or SP2 tossed the ball to the Treasurer, <u>the person who tossed the ball earns one point</u>. In other words, SP1 and SP2 earn points when they get the chance to toss the ball to the Treasurer. Of course, you could toss the ball to whomever you want, but you will only earn points when you pass the ball to the Treasurer.
                So, for example, if SP1 tosses the ball to the Treasurer, SP1 will earn one point and SP2 will not earn any points. Likewise, if SP2 tosses the ball to the Treasurer, SP2 will earn one point and SP1 will not earn anything. 
                <br><br>
                Keep in mind that SP1 and SP2 cannot earn points by tossing the ball to each other.
                SP1 and SP2 can only earn points by tossing the ball to the Treasurer. So, for example, if SP1 tosses the ball to SP2, neither SP1 or SP2 will earn any points. But whoever then throws the ball to the Treasurer will earn a point.</p>","0","","","","","",""

    You may choose to reduce SP2’s earnings by giving up some of your own earnings. This is a <u>one-time, one-sided decision</u>. This means only you make this decision; SP2 will not make a corresponding decision.<br><br>

    For every <b>$0.01</b> you give up, SP2’s earnings are reduced by <b>$0.05</b>.<br>
    For example, giving up <b>$0.03</b> reduces SP2’s earnings by <b>$0.15</b>. Choosing $0 means no change to either participant's earnings.<br>

I was pleasantly surprised that player 2 passed the ball to me a couple of time when they were ahead. It was a kind gesture that helped me keep when the treasurer wasn't passing to me."",""dv1_oe_playtime_satisfaction"":""Yes i am satisfied with how long i got to play. The ball was passed around long enough without getting boring. I was patient while waiting for the ball to get passed to me and was quick to return the pass. If the game had lasted any longer i would have probably lost interested and or started to multitask while finishing the game."",""dv1_oe_earnings_satisfaction"":""Yes i am satisfied with he money i made from the game. I wasn't expecting much so anything is better than nothing. It was nice that player 2 and i are close in earning so it felt like a fair game. I did not want to deduct anything from their earnings."",""dv1_oe_treasurer_behavior"":""I had not expectations going into the game. It seemed like the treasurer favored passing to player 2 though which was a bit annoying a first. But once player two passed to me that helped make it feel more fair. I wonder if the game started with the treasure passing to me first if they would have continued to pass to me more than player 2? "",""dv1_oe_sp2_behavior"":""Player 2 was playing fair and kindly. They got the first ball passed them from the treasurer and more balls passed to them over the entire game. It seems like each time they got ahead by a couple of points they would pass the ball to me to help my catch up and earn points within their range. It made the game feel better."",""dv1_oe_message_to_treasurer"":""I would just nicely ask why the choose to pass to player 2 more often and were they following any pattern. Maybe they find it easier throwing in the right direction as opposed to the left where i was positioned, i would ask them that. I would say that their passing to player 2 more often made me feel left out at times."",""dv1_oe_message_to_sp2"":""Good game, thanks so much for including me and passing the ball when you got further ahead. I appreciate you looking out for me and giving me a chance to catch up. It made the game more rewarding for me to stay in and you made it more fun for me.""}","","","","","",""
