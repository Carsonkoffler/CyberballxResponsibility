    <p style = ""text-align: start; width: 900px""> You are being invited to participate in a research study titled: The Influence of Social Interactions on Decision Making.<br><br>
        This study is being done by Michael McCullough, PhD (Principal Investigator) from UC San Diego. You were selected to participate in this study because you are a representative member of the society the investigators wish to study. 
        The purpose of this research study is to explore how nonverbal social interactions affect the way people talk to themselves. Your participation in this research should last no longer than 30 minutes. If you agree to take part in this study, you will be asked to complete several surveys that ask about your feelings, beliefs, judgments, and personal background.
        Your participation in this study is completely voluntary and you can withdraw at any time. Choosing not to participate or withdrawing will result in no penalty or loss of benefits to which you are entitled. Research sometimes requires that information regarding its purpose not be shared with the research participants because its knowledge could impact the results of the research. 
        Note that none of the aspects of the research being withheld are reasonably expected to affect your willingness to take part. While the tasks you will be asked to perform for this research have been explained, the full intent of the research will not be provided until the completion of the study. At that time, you will have the opportunity to ask questions, including about the purpose of the study and the procedures used, and withdraw your data if you so choose.
        If you have questions about this project or if you have a research-related problem, you may contact the researcher(s), Michael McCullough, Ph.D., Department of Psychology, University of California, San Diego, 9500 Gilman Drive, La Jolla, CA 92093-0109 and by email at memccullough@ucsd.edu. If you have any questions concerning your rights as a research subject, you may contact the UC San Diego Office of IRB Administration at irb@ucsd.edu or 858-246-4777.
        By participating in this research, you are indicating that you are at least 18 years old, have read this consent form, and agree to participate in this research study. Please keep this consent form for your records.</p>

                 The instructions for the game will be provided in the next section. To ensure that everyone understands the rules, there will be a short quiz.

                <p style=""width: 1000px; text-align: start"">In Cyberball there are three players: Standard Player 1 (SP1), Standard Player 2 (SP2), and a Treasurer. <b>You are SP1</b>.
                <br><br>
                Your objective in Cyberball is to earn points by tossing a ball. At the end of the game, the points will be converted into a monetary bonus. Each point you earn is worth $0.05. To help you keep track of points, there will be a scoreboard displayed in the top-right corner of the screen during the game.<br>
                The way the game works is that SP1 and SP2 individually earn points by tossing the ball to the Treasurer. Each time that SP1 or SP2 tossed the ball to the Treasurer, <u>the person who tossed the ball earns one point</u>. In other words, SP1 and SP2 earn points when they get the chance to toss the ball to the Treasurer. Of course, you could toss the ball to whomever you want, but you will only earn points when you pass the ball to the Treasurer.
                So, for example, if SP1 tosses the ball to the Treasurer, SP1 will earn one point and SP2 will not earn any points. Likewise, if SP2 tosses the ball to the Treasurer, SP2 will earn one point and SP1 will not earn anything. 
                <br><br>
                Keep in mind that SP1 and SP2 cannot earn points by tossing the ball to each other.
                SP1 and SP2 can only earn points by tossing the ball to the Treasurer. So, for example, if SP1 tosses the ball to SP2, neither SP1 or SP2 will earn any points. But whoever then throws the ball to the Treasurer will earn a point.</p>","0","","","","","",""

    You may choose to reduce SP2’s earnings by giving up some of your own earnings. This is a <u>one-time, one-sided decision</u>. This means only you make this decision; SP2 will not make a corresponding decision.<br><br>

    For every <b>$0.01</b> you give up, SP2’s earnings are reduced by <b>$0.05</b>.<br>
    For example, giving up <b>$0.03</b> reduces SP2’s earnings by <b>$0.15</b>. Choosing $0 means no change to either participant's earnings.<br>

Even when things didn’t go perfectly, I adapted quickly and learned from the experience, which made the overall performance feel successful and rewarding. Thanks for this, was good time."",""dv1_oe_playtime_satisfaction"":""I’m satisfied with how much I got to play because I was given enough time to stay engaged, contribute meaningfully, and find my rhythm in the game. The playing time felt fair and balanced, allowing me to gain experience and stay involved throughout. Was an interesting game to be honest."",""dv1_oe_earnings_satisfaction"":""Yes, I am satisfied with how much money I made because it matched my expectations and felt fair for the effort I put in. The amount reflected my time, contribution, and responsibility, making the experience feel rewarding, balanced, and worthwhile overall, and aligned well with my expectations. Good job sir."",""dv1_oe_treasurer_behavior"":""I disliked the treasurer’s behavior during the game because it felt biased toward SP2 and did not meet my expectations of fairness. Their decisions appeared uneven and affected the overall experience. I wish they had remained more neutral or nice or fair, and applied rules consistently to all players. Horrible guy."",""dv1_oe_sp2_behavior"":""They were quite nice and tossed the ball to me a few times. I think it would be nice to have a chatbox to communicate with other players so we can decide on what to do. I think it met my expectations. Thanks for being fair despite the asshole treasurer."",""dv1_oe_message_to_treasurer"":""You were unfair in how you handled the game, and it was frustrating for me. Your decisions felt biased and affected my experience negatively. When it comes to monetary compensation, I believe you should be more neutral, transparent, and consistent, so everyone feels respected and treated fairly throughout the game. You are an asshole, play more fair. "",""dv1_oe_message_to_sp2"":""I felt that you played the game in a fair and respectful way, which made the experience more enjoyable for me. You were easy to work with and stayed neutral. Sorry I didn't pass the ball more, I was trying to even out the compensation and points system. Thank you""}","","","","","",""
