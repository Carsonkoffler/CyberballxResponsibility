    <p style = ""text-align: start; width: 900px""> You are being invited to participate in a research study titled: The Influence of Social Interactions on Decision Making.<br><br>
        This study is being done by Michael McCullough, PhD (Principal Investigator) from UC San Diego. You were selected to participate in this study because you are a representative member of the society the investigators wish to study. 
        The purpose of this research study is to explore how nonverbal social interactions affect the way people talk to themselves. Your participation in this research should last no longer than 30 minutes. If you agree to take part in this study, you will be asked to complete several surveys that ask about your feelings, beliefs, judgments, and personal background.
        Your participation in this study is completely voluntary and you can withdraw at any time. Choosing not to participate or withdrawing will result in no penalty or loss of benefits to which you are entitled. Research sometimes requires that information regarding its purpose not be shared with the research participants because its knowledge could impact the results of the research. 
        Note that none of the aspects of the research being withheld are reasonably expected to affect your willingness to take part. While the tasks you will be asked to perform for this research have been explained, the full intent of the research will not be provided until the completion of the study. At that time, you will have the opportunity to ask questions, including about the purpose of the study and the procedures used, and withdraw your data if you so choose.
        If you have questions about this project or if you have a research-related problem, you may contact the researcher(s), Michael McCullough, Ph.D., Department of Psychology, University of California, San Diego, 9500 Gilman Drive, La Jolla, CA 92093-0109 and by email at memccullough@ucsd.edu. If you have any questions concerning your rights as a research subject, you may contact the UC San Diego Office of IRB Administration at irb@ucsd.edu or 858-246-4777.
        By participating in this research, you are indicating that you are at least 18 years old, have read this consent form, and agree to participate in this research study. Please keep this consent form for your records.</p>

                 <p style=""width: 900px; text-align: start"">Thank you for agreeing to participate in this study! This study seeks to understand how social interactions influence our decision-making processes.<br><br>
                 In this study, you will play a virtual ball-tossing game with two other participants. The game is designed to simulate social interactions and observe how they affect how you make decisions towards other people.<br><br>
                 The instructions for the game will be provided in the next section. To ensure that everyone understands the rules, there will be a short quiz. If you get any answers wrong, don't worry—you will have the opportunity to review the instructions and retake the quiz until you get all the answers correct.<br><br>

                <p style=""width: 1000px; text-align: start"">In Cyberball there are three players: Standard Player 1 (SP1), Standard Player 2 (SP2), and a Treasurer. <b>You are SP1</b>.
                <br><br>
                Your objective in Cyberball is to earn points by tossing a ball. At the end of the game, the points will be converted into a monetary bonus. Each point you earn is worth $0.05. To help you keep track of points, there will be a scoreboard displayed in the top-right corner of the screen during the game.<br>
                <br>
                The way the game works is that SP1 and SP2 individually earn points by tossing the ball to the Treasurer. Each time that SP1 or SP2 tossed the ball to the Treasurer, <u>the person who tossed the ball earns one point</u>. In other words, SP1 and SP2 earn points when they get the chance to toss the ball to the Treasurer. Of course, you could toss the ball to whomever you want, but you will only earn points when you pass the ball to the Treasurer.
                So, for example, if SP1 tosses the ball to the Treasurer, SP1 will earn one point and SP2 will not earn any points. Likewise, if SP2 tosses the ball to the Treasurer, SP2 will earn one point and SP1 will not earn anything. 
                <br><br>
                Keep in mind that SP1 and SP2 cannot earn points by tossing the ball to each other.
                SP1 and SP2 can only earn points by tossing the ball to the Treasurer. So, for example, if SP1 tosses the ball to SP2, neither SP1 or SP2 will earn any points. But whoever then throws the ball to the Treasurer will earn a point.</p>","0","","","","","",""

    You may choose to reduce SP2’s earnings by giving up some of your own earnings. This is a <u>one-time, one-sided decision</u>. This means only you make this decision; SP2 will not make a corresponding decision.<br><br>

    For every <b>$0.01</b> you give up, SP2’s earnings are reduced by <b>$0.05</b>.<br>
    For example, giving up <b>$0.03</b> reduces SP2’s earnings by <b>$0.15</b>. Choosing $0 means no change to either participant's earnings.<br>
    Earnings for either participant cannot go below <b>$0</b>.<br><br>

    You may move the slider below to see how different choices would affect both participants’ earnings. Moving the slider does not finalize your decision. Your decision is only locked in once you click 'Continue' and move on to the next task.<br><br>

    There is no correct or expected choice. Please use the slider to indicate how much of your own earnings you would like to give up in order to reduce SP2's earnings.

Player 2 doesn't want to throw the ball to me because they probably don't think they will get it back or maybe they get more points by throwing it to the treasurer too. It's not a very fun game to play at all. "",""dv1_oe_playtime_satisfaction"":""I feel like I didn't get to play that much because player 2 wanted to hog the ball because they figured out that I wasn't throwing the ball back to them, but that was only because I didn't get any points for doing that so I did not have a good reason to. "",""dv1_oe_earnings_satisfaction"":""No. The amount of money possible was really low, first of all, and then it was even lower because I had no control over when I would have the ball and when I would not have the ball. It would have been nice to be able to make more money. "",""dv1_oe_treasurer_behavior"":""I think the treasurer was pretty even. The probably did not care who they threw the ball to. Maybe they made the same amount of money either way. It was basically the same as what I expected. It would have been nice if they threw the ball to me every time. "",""dv1_oe_sp2_behavior"":""I thought they behaved fine. They were trying to get the most money for themselves so who can blame them? I would have done exactly the same thing as they did since they probably got more money from throwing to the treasurer too and they might have needed it for groceries. "",""dv1_oe_message_to_treasurer"":""It didn't impact me that much. It is just a game and you can literally only make a few cents tops. It's not like it is making or breaking the bank for me. I would tell them I hope they had a good time playing the game and thanks for playing. "",""dv1_oe_message_to_sp2"":""It didn't impact me much. I hope they needed the money more than I did. I wasn't going to be a jerk and try to take some of their money back and be selfish like that. I would also say I hope they had a good time playing the game. ""}","","","","","",""
